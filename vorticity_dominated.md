### <span style="color: red">Vortex breakdown in concentrated vortices with axial velocity</span>
Axial vortices are prevalent in engineering flows, such as flow past delta wings as well as in geophysical flows, such as super-cell thunderstorms. Axial vortices are prone to the phenomenon of ‘vortex breakdown,’ which affects these flows severely. For example, vortex breakdown in flow past delta wings results in loss of control over control surfaces. Analysis of vortex breakdown is fundamental to the understanding of the physics and thereby controlling and forecasting these flows.

A model often used to study vortex breakdown is the flow generated by a rotating lid inside a closed circular cylinder. This flow depends on two non-dimensional parameters: (i) aspect ratio, defined as $$\Gamma = H/R$$, where $$H$$ is the height of the cylinder, and $$R$$ is the radius of the cylinder; and (ii) Reynolds number, defined as $$Re = \Omega R^{2}/\nu$$, where $$\Omega$$ is the speed at which the lid is rotating, and $$\nu$$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid used. This configuration is known to exhibit the bubble-type vortex breakdown.

A schematic of the changes in the flow topology and transitions in the incompressible Vogel-Escudier flow.
Box A (red dashed region, also marked in the map) shows the changes in the vortex breakdown bubble and transitions in the flow, along with the phase space associated with the bifurcations, with respect to $$Re$$ for $$\Gamma=2.5$$.
Similarly, box B (yellow dashed region, also marked in the map) shows the variations in the breakdown bubble and flow topology with respect to the aspect ratios at $$Re=4000$$.
