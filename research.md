### Research interests and approach:
My primary research interest lies in the area of fluid mechanics.
My primary approach is to analyze a problem through numerical simulation, preferably Direct Numerical Simulation. I use various analytical techniques and theories to analyze the data obtained from these simulations to gain an understanding of the physics of the problem. Specific research interests are detailed below:

[**Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) \& High Performance Computing (HPC)**](/hpc/): High order, high fidelity simulations, Large scale parallel computations on multi-core heterogeneous architecture (CPU+GPU), scalability on large clusters.
