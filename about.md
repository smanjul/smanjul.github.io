## Work

<!Learning is my biggest motivator.>
<!{:.faded}>

I'm a Research Faculty at the Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Colorado Boulder interested in Fluids. In particular, rotating flows, convective flows, and double-diffusive flows (my current research topic), with an application to geophysical flows. 

I ❤️ open source. I aim to work entirely on open-source projects both
professionally and personally.
