    A bit about myself
{:.faded}

I use numerical simulations to study fluid flows. My research interests include turbulent flows, convective flows ranging from engineering to geophysical flows, and high-performance computing. I am interested in building computational frameworks for science and engineering problems.
Have a look at my [research](/research/) to learn more about it. 

Since August 2021, I have been a Research Faculty at the Department of [Applied Mathematics at CU Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/){:target="_blank"} (University of Colorado at Boulder). Here, I am working with Prof. Keith Julien in collaboration with Prof. Edgar Knobloch (Physics Department, UC Berkeley) and Prof. Chang Liu (UConn).

From 2020 to July 2021, I was a Post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India).

Before that, I was a Project Officer in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Madras.

I obtained my Ph.D. in 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. A. Sameen](https://home.iitm.ac.in/sameen/){:target="_blank"} in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Madras. For my thesis, I studied vortex breakdown in vortices with axial flows.
