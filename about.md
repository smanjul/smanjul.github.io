!<-- ## Work -->

A bit about myself
{:.faded}

Since August 2021, I have been a Research Faculty at the Department of Applied Mathematics at CU Boulder (University of Colorado at Boulder). Here, I am working with Prof. Keith Julien, in collaboration with Prof. Edgar Knobloch (Physics Department, UC Berkeley) and Prof. Chang Liu (UConn).

From 2020 to July 2021, I was a Post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India).

Before that, I was a Project Officer in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Madras.

I obtained my Ph.D. in 2020 under the supervision of Prof. A. Sameen in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Madras. For my thesis, I studied vortex breakdown in vortices with axial flows.
