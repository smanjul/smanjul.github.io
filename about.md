## Work

Learning is my biggest motivator.
{:.faded}

I'm a Research Faculty at the Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Colorado Boulder interested in Fluids. In particular, rotating flows, convective flows, and double-diffusive flows (my current research topic), with an application to geophysical flows. 

I ❤️ open source. I aim to work entirely on open-source projects both
professionally and personally.

## Travel

When I think about what truly makes me happy — it's travel.
{:.faded}

At 22, I set the goal of traveling to 30 countries before turning 30.
At 22, I'd only been to 1 country outside the US. By 26, I traveled to 29 countries in
4 years, and hit my goal well ahead of time. Onwards to experiencing more
cultures—maybe *40 countries before 40*?
