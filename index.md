    A bit about myself
{:.faded}

I use numerical simulations to study fluid flows. My research interests include turbulent flows, convective flows ranging from engineering to geophysical flows, and high-performance computing. I am interested in building computational frameworks for science and engineering problems.
Have a look at my [research](/research/) to learn more about it. 

Starting May 2025, I have joined as an assistant professor at the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/faculty/manjul-sharma/){:target="_blank"} within Ecole Centrale School of Engineering at the Mahindra University, Hyderbad, India.
Before this, I was a Project Scientist at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Madras, Chennai, India, from Aug 2024 to April 2025.

From Aug 2021 to Jul 2024, I worked as a Research Faculty at the Department of [Applied Mathematics at CU Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/){:target="_blank"} (University of Colorado at Boulder). There, I was working with the Late Prof. Keith Julien in collaboration with [Prof. Edgar Knobloch](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/edgar-knobloch){:target="_blank"} (Physics Department, UC Berkeley) and [Prof. Chang Liu](https://changliulab.engineering.uconn.edu/){:target="_blank"} (UConn).

From November 2020 to mid-August 2021, I was a Post-doctoral researcher in the [Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Madras](https://ae.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} (Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India).

Before that, I was a Project Officer in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Madras.

I obtained my Ph.D. in 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. A. Sameen](https://home.iitm.ac.in/sameen/){:target="_blank"} in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Madras. For my thesis, I studied breakdown in vortices with axial flows.
